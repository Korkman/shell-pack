# dool requires plugins in either global locations or a subdirectory "plugins"
# adjacent to its binary. we aim for the latter, but don't want bin/plugins,
# so we created bin/dool.d/plugins, which places bin/dool.d/dool outside of PATH.
# since we don't want to inflate PATH anymore, and a symlink doesn't work,
# we install this script as bin/dool to proxy around.
